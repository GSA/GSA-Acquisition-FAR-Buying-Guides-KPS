# Commercial Software License Terms for Government Procurement

## General Approach to Commercial Software Licensing

When procuring commercial software licenses, the Department of Defense (DoD) policy is to use existing commercial license terms and conditions to the maximum extent practicable, with two key limitations:
1. Terms must not conflict with Federal law
2. Terms must satisfy user needs

## Negotiation Process

Where standard commercial terms do not meet Government requirements, the following approach is used:
- Negotiate specific terms with the software company
- Consider the risk to the software owner
- Propose changes that are least impactful to the vendor
- Ensure consistency with Government laws and policies
- Avoid impacts to user needs or pricing

## Common Unacceptable Commercial License Terms

### Indemnification Provisions
- Indemnity typically means securing reimbursement for damages
- Government generally cannot indemnify another entity
- May violate the Anti-Deficiency Act

### Attorney's Fees Provisions
- Not available in certain federal agency claims
- May be considered unauthorized funding obligations

### State or Foreign Choice of Law/Jurisdiction
- Government is not subject to state or international law
- Governing law must be federal common law
- Jurisdiction must be U.S. federal courts

### Binding Arbitration Provisions
- Government does not generally agree to binding arbitration
- Disputes should be settled under agreement dispute clauses

### Audit Provisions
- Cannot grant unauthorized access to Government facilities
- Restricted by security-related laws and regulations

### Late Penalty Provisions
- May conflict with Prompt Payment Act
- Cannot agree to additional compensation beyond existing penalties

### Third-Party Software License Terms

- Third-party licenses must be provided prior to award

### Tax Provisions
- Do not accept terms indicating fees are not tax-inclusive

### Injunctive Relief Provisions
- Government cannot be enjoined for copyright or patent infringement
- Relief governed by dispute clauses and federal law

Companies seeking to engage the Government should:
