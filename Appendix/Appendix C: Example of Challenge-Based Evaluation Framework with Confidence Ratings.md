# Evaluation Documentation  

Rather than numerical scoring, the evaluation team collectively develops a narrative assessment for each vendor that:  

- Summarizes confidence levels across all challenge areas.  
- Provides a brief reason for the overall confidence determination.  
- Briefly assesses overall fit with requirements.
