# GSA Acquisition Letter MV-2024-01: SaaS License Upfront Payments

GSA's [Acquisition Letter MV-2024-01](https://www.gsa.gov/system/files/MV-2024-01.pdf) clarifies that upfront payments for cloud-based Software as a Service (SaaS) licenses are **not considered advance payments** under federal regulations. This distinction allows for pricing flexibility while ensuring compliance with statutory limitations on contract financing.

## Criteria for Valid Upfront Payments

For an upfront payment to be valid, the following criteria must be met:

- **Immediate Access**: Payment occurs contemporaneously with software access.
- **Fixed Pricing**: The license follows a fixed-price model, with or without economic price adjustments.
- **Defined Term**: Pricing is based on a seat, unit, or subscription model covering a fixed period.
- **No Usage-Based Pricing**: Costs must not fluctuate based on consumption beyond quantity.
- **No Additional Upfront Costs**: The price should only reflect the license fee without extra preconditions.
- **Continuous Service**: Access to the software must remain uninterrupted for the contract term.
