# Modular SaaS Procurements

Modular acquisition strategies reduce risk, improve delivery timelines, and adapt to evolving requirements. But not all modular strategies are the same. When acquiring Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) solutions, modular procurement looks very different from modular custom software development. Understanding these differences helps tailor more effective solicitations and contracts to SaaS.

## What is modular SaaS procurement?

Modular SaaS procurement involves acquiring an existing commercial software product using a phased contract structure. To de-risk deployment and adoption, break the procurement into manageable, outcome-driven phases that reflect how SaaS actually delivers and is consumed.

### Example of Modular SaaS CLIN Structure

| CLIN       | Description |
|------------|------------|
| **0001**   | Implementation & Configuration Services, Agency IT Security Requirements, and ATO Requirements |
| **0002**   | Pilot Deployment (30-90 days, limited user SaaS licenses) |
| **0003**   | Full Deployment (post-pilot, all user SaaS licenses) |
| **0004**   | Training & Knowledge Transfer |
| **0005**   | Ongoing Support Services |
| **0006**   | Optional Add-On Licenses or Integrations |

Each CLIN reflects a modular activity aligned with how SaaS platforms are adopted â€“ from early testing through full operational use.

Here's the text converted to markdown:

A modular SaaS structure enables federal buyers to adopt commercial solutions confidently, with the flexibility to test, adapt, and expand based on mission needs.

Structuring SaaS procurements modularly ensures:

- Faster time to value.
- Better user adoption.
- Lower technical risk.
- Flexibility to scale or exit.
- Alignment with agile and iterative procurement policies.

Modular SaaS is characterized by using:

- A live, commercial solution (not built from scratch).
- Phased configuration, pilot testing, integration, and rollout.
- Contract Line Item Numbers (CLINs) for pilot deployment, implementation, training, subscription, support, and optional services.
- Evaluation based on demonstration and real-world performance ('show, don't tell').

## What if my vendor failed to deliver?

One of the benefits of a modular approach is the flexibility to rapidly address vendor performance issues (i.e., if one fails, another capable vendor should be brought in). For example, an agency used a 'quick transition' clause under Section H. Special Contract Requirements--

> ### H.4 AWARD OF REPLACEMENT TASK ORDER (Quick Transition) July 2019
> 
> (a) In the event a task order is terminated by the AGENCY NAME as described below, AGENCY NAME reserves the right to award a replacement task order to one of the offerors from the initial task order competition.
> 
> (b) If the AGENCY NAME decides to (1) terminate the task order under the termination provisions of the contract, or (2) not exercise a performance period option under the task order, the AGENCY NAME may award the task order work to one of the offerors from the initial task order competition based upon the results from the evaluation that supported the award of the initial task order. Offerors shall indicate in their proposal the duration their proposal is valid for under this clause but no longer than eighteen (18) months from initial task order award.
> 
> (c) The decision as to how the award will be made for the replacement task order will be at the sole discretion of AGENCY NAME.
