# Enable Meaningful Vendor Interaction Post-Solicitation

Structured communication with vendors during the evaluation process will uncover how well their solutions meet your needs. During the challenge- and demo-based evaluation approaches, provide opportunities for dialogue, such as:

- Allowing evaluation team members to ask clarifying questions during or after vendor presentations.
- Encouraging vendors to explain **why** their approach works, not just **how** it works.
- Asking vendors to walk through how they configured the solution to meet agency constraints.
- Probing how the solution handles specific edge cases or business rules.
- Clarifying how data security, user access, or scalability is managed in practice.

These interactions ensure the evaluation is based not just on what's shown, but shows a deeper understanding of how the solution performs and how the vendor thinks about solving real agency challenges. To avoid any assumptions or exceptions, which raise the risk premium in the proposal, it is best to have these interactions prior to receiving detailed technical or price proposals (e.g., in the early phase of a multiple-phased procurement).
