# Define and prioritize business requirements 
Building with the end in mind ensures your SaaS procurement prioritizes outcomes. Before drafting the solicitation, clearly define what success looks like for your agency and how the solution will help achieve mission goals.
## Clarify mission and strategic objectives
- What core business needs does the SaaS solution need to address?
- How does the solution support broader agency IT strategies, digital transformation goals, and policy alignment?
- Will it help modernize outdated processes or enhance service delivery?
  
## Define success metrics
- Establish clear Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure outcomes.
- Consider full software lifecycle costs, including licensing, renewals, data migration, and transition planning.
- Ensure the solution can scale with your agency’s needs and remain flexible to accommodate future requirements without costly rework.
- Work together to prioritize requirements 

## Work closely with end users and stakeholders to gather real needs and pain points.
- Use the MoSCoW Method to prioritize:

  Must – Essential to success.

  Should – Important but not critical.

  Could – Beneficial if feasible.

  Won’t – Not needed for this procurement.
  
- Focus on business outcomes rather than feature lists.

## Identify business process gaps
- Where do current processes break down or not work efficiently?
- Can we automate manual or repetitive tasks?
- Can the agency change business processes without adverse impacts to use a SaaS solution?
- Can a SaaS solution enable process improvement or transformation?

# Summary
By grounding your procurement in clear, prioritized business needs, you increase the likelihood of selecting a solution that is fit-for-purpose, scalable, and aligned with your agency’s long-term mission.
