# Security and compliance as a foundation
Before engaging with vendors, determine the required FedRAMP impact level to align with federal security standards. Also, assessing data ownership, data storage location, data encryption, data access rights, and compliance requirements before issuing a solicitation help mitigate risks and clarify responsibilities. Documentation of the requirements including provisions for continuous monitoring and security updates to keep the system compliant over time.

Another key aspect of SaaS procurement is defining an exit strategy early to prevent vendor lock-in and ensure smooth transitions. This includes specifying data extraction formats and transition support upfront to migrate seamlessly if needed. 

Planning for post-contract access to data ensures that agencies keep control over critical information even after the agreement ends. 

Also, outlining vendor obligations for transition and knowledge transfer in the contract establishes clear expectations for both parties, reducing disruptions and ensuring long-term operational resilience.

If a government-wide contract vehicle is established, a common approach for data migration and exit should be addressed at the vehicle level so that consistent and sound standards are applied to all user agencies.
