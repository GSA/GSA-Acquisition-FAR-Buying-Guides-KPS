# How to Participate in This Project

There are two main ways you can contribute to this project on GitHub: **forking the repository** and **submitting an issue**. Whether you want to suggest a change or share an idea, your input is valuable!

## Option 1: Forking the Repository

Forking allows you to make direct contributions to the project by editing files, such as this `.MD` file. While it may seem complex at first, using GitHub's website makes it simple.

### Steps to Fork and Contribute:
1. **Fork the Repository**
   - Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner of the repository page.
   - This creates a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.

2. **Open the `.MD` File to Edit**
   - Navigate to your forked repository.
   - Locate the `.MD` file you want to update.
   - Click the file to open it, then select the "Edit" (pencil) icon.

3. **Make Your Changes**
   - Edit the content directly in the GitHub web editor.
   - Ensure your updates improve clarity, or accuracy.

### Keep the change limited to one proposed change per pull request

4. **Propose Your Changes**
   - Scroll down to the "Commit changes" section.
   - Add a short, clear description of what you updated.
   - Choose "Commit directly to the `main` branch" or create a new branch.

### Remember: Keep the change limited to one proposed change per pull request

5. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Navigate back to the main repository (not your fork).
   - Click "Pull requests" > "New pull request."
   - Select your fork and branch, then click "Create pull request."
   - Provide a brief summary of your changes and submit the pull request.

## Option 2: Submitting an Issue

If you have a suggestion, question, or idea but don't want to modify the file yourself, submitting an issue is a great way to contribute. Issues help maintainers track ideas and discussions.

### When to Submit an Issue:
- You have a suggestion for improving the guide that requires more context than a pull request.
- You need clarification on something in the project.

### How to Submit an Issue:
1. **Go to the Issues Tab**
   - On the repositoryâ€™s GitHub page, click the "Issues" tab.

2. **Click "New Issue"**
   - Click the green "New Issue" button.

3. **Describe Your Issue Clearly**
   - Provide a descriptive title.
   - Write a detailed explanation of the issue, including specific sections that need improvement.
   - If applicable, suggest alternative wording or structure.

4. **Submit the Issue**
   - Click "Submit new issue" and wait for maintainers or contributors to respond.

By forking the repository or submitting issues, you help improve the project for everyone. Thank you for contributing!





# Forking vs. Pull Requests: Whatâ€™s the Difference?

âœ… TL;DR:

**Forking** â†’ Makes a personal copy of the content.
- You can freely make changes to this forked repo without affecting the original.

- When youâ€™re ready to suggest changes to the original, you can submit a pull request.

**Pull Request ("PR")** â†’ Submits your changes for review and merging into the original.
- You "request" the original project owner to "pull" in your changes.

- The owner can review, comment, and either approve or reject your changes.


**_You don't always have to fork, but you always have to submit a pull request_**

ðŸ’¡ **Real-World Example**

1. Fork the content â†’ You now have your own version to make changes freely.

2. Make changes â†’ Add new information, suggestopms, tips, improvements or typos in your fork.

3. Create a pull request â†’ Suggest your changes to the original project.

4. GSA Team Reviews â†’ They review, request changes (if needed), or approve your PR.

5. If the PR is approved, the PR is merged â†’ Your changes become part of the original project.
